# facebook-by-nick--v-2

Tried to create an instagram/facebook clone with a few better features and a better interface  and UI
this app works on nodejs has an express server and a mongodb database it is deployed remotely for trial on 
https://addmie.herokuapp.com/



some features that distinguish this app from other social networking apps ,
# secret messages
users can send messages to other users without them knowing who the sender is,
however, they have an option to block such messages from anyone
# no size limit for posting pictures
while posting on other social media apps we have to crop our pictures ,while on addmie its completely optional
# infinite conversations and activites 
other applications restrict their usage but applying shadow ban on hyperactive users ,although addmie does not have such restrictions,
also one user can start infinite number of conversations with other users 



this was the first prototype and some features may be added in future like
-revealing secret messsages
-infinite comment replies
-one click login
-android app for addmie
-proper loading of profile pictures
-sharing posts and photos in chatbox
-about me section (bio)
-better ui 
-video streamings
